       This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source
       and documentation for Perl, support, and related matters.

       WWhhaatt mmaacchhiinneess ssuuppppoorrtt ppeerrll??  WWhheerree ddoo II ggeett iitt??

       The standard release of perl (the one maintained by the perl develop-
       ment team) is distributed only in source code form.  You can find this
       at http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz , which is in a standard
       Internet format (a gzipped archive in POSIX tar format).

       Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.  Virtually
       all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl’s native
       platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX,
       BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.

       Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms, including Apple
       systems, can be found http://www.cpan.org/ports/ directory.  Because
       these are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in fact
       do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways.  You’ll have to
       check their respective release notes to see just what the differences
       are.  These differences can be either positive (e.g. extensions for the
       features of the particular platform that are not supported in the
       source release of perl) or negative (e.g.  might be based upon a less
       current source release of perl).

       If you don’t have a C compiler because your vendor for whatever reasons
       did not include one with your system, the best thing to do is grab a
       binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile perl with.
       CPAN only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to get free
       compilers for, not for Unix systems.

       Some URLs that might help you are:

           http://www.cpan.org/ports/
           http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html

       Someone looking for a perl for Win16 might look to Laszlo Molnar’s
       djgpp port in http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos , which comes with clear
       installation instructions.  A simple installation guide for MS-DOS
       using Ilya Zakharevich’s OS/2 port is available at
       http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html and similarly for Windows
       3.1 at http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html .

       Since you don’t have a C compiler, you’re doomed and your vendor should
       be sacrificed to the Sun gods.  But that doesn’t help you.

       What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system
       first.  Consult the Usenet FAQs for your operating system for informa-
       tion on where to get such a binary version.

       That’s probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.
       You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
       eventually live on, and then type "make install".  Most other
       approaches are doomed to failure.

       One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print
       out the hard-coded @INC that perl looks through for libraries:

           % perl -le ’print for @INC’

       If this command lists any paths that don’t exist on your system, then
       you may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or
       create symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.  @INC is
       also printed as part of the output of

           % perl -V

       You might also want to check out "How do I keep my own module/library
       directory?" in perlfaq8.

       CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a ~1.2Gb archive
       replicated on nearly 200 machines all over the world.  CPAN contains
       source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts, and many third-
       party modules and extensions, designed for everything from commercial
       database interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web walking and CGI
       scripts.  The master web site for CPAN is http://www.cpan.org/ and
       there is the CPAN Multiplexer at http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html which
       will choose a mirror near you via DNS.  See http://www.perl.com/CPAN
       (without a slash at the end) for how this process works. Also,
       http://mirror.cpan.org/ has a nice interface to the
       http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY mirror directory.

       See the CPAN FAQ at http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html for answers
       to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN including how to
       become a mirror.

       CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on CPAN sites.
       CPAN indicates the base directory of a CPAN mirror, and the rest of the
       path is the path from that directory to the file.  For instance, if
       you’re using ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN as your CPAN
       site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
       ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh .

       Considering that there are close to two thousand existing modules in
       the archive, one probably exists to do nearly anything you can think
       of.  Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl
       core modules; development support; operating system interfaces; net-
       working, devices, and interprocess communication; data type utilities;
       database interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other languages;
       filenames, file systems, and file locking; internationalization and
       locale; world wide web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving
       and compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow utili-
       ties; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules; and miscellaneous
       modules.

       See http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html or
       http://search.cpan.org/ for a more complete list of modules by cate-
       gory.

       CPAN is not affiliated with O’Reilly Media.

       Certainly not.  Larry expects that he’ll be certified before Perl is.

       The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribu-
       tion.  If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the docu-
       mentation installed as well: type "man perl" if you’re on a system
       resembling Unix.  This will lead you to other important man pages,
       including how to set your $MANPATH.  If you’re not on a Unix system,
       access to the documentation will be different; for example, documenta-
       tion might only be in HTML format.  All proper perl installations have
       fully-accessible documentation.

       You might also try "perldoc perl" in case your system doesn’t have a
       proper man command, or it’s been misinstalled.  If that doesn’t work,
       try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.

       If all else fails, consult http://perldoc.perl.org/ which has the com-
       plete documentation in HTML and PDF format.

       Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section below for
       more details.

       Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases
       include perltoot for objects or perlboot for a beginner’s approach to
       objects, perlopentut for file opening semantics, perlreftut for manag-
       ing references, perlretut for regular expressions, perlthrtut for
       threads, perldebtut for debugging, and perlxstut for linking C and Perl
       together.  There may be more by the time you read this.  These URLs
       might also be useful:

       Several groups devoted to the Perl language are on Usenet:

           comp.lang.perl.announce             Moderated announcement group
           comp.lang.perl.misc                 High traffic general Perl discussion
           comp.lang.perl.moderated        Moderated discussion group
           comp.lang.perl.modules              Use and development of Perl modules
           comp.lang.perl.tk                   Using Tk (and X) from Perl

           comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  Writing CGI scripts for the Web.

       Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those groups, and
       comp.lang.perl itself officially removed.  While that group may still
       be found on some news servers, it is unwise to use it, because postings
       there will not appear on news servers which honour the official list of
       group names.  Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics which do not have a
       more-appropriate specific group.

       There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists sponsored by
       perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org , a web interface to the same lists at
       http://nntp.perl.org/group/ and these lists are also available under
       the "perl.*" hierarchy at http://groups.google.com . Other groups are
       listed at http://lists.perl.org/ ( also known as http://lists.cpan.org/
       ).

       A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site, http://www.perl-
       monks.org/ , or the Perl Beginners mailing list
       http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners .

       Note that none of the above are supposed to write your code for you:
       asking questions about particular problems or general advice is fine,
       but asking someone to write your code for free is not very cool.

       You should post source code to whichever group is most appropriate, but
       feel free to cross-post to comp.lang.perl.misc.  If you want to cross-
       post to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their posting stan-
       dards, including setting the Followup-To header line to NOT include
       alt.sources; see their FAQ (
       http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/ ) for details.

       If you’re just looking for software, first use Google (
       http://www.google.com ), Google’s usenet search interface (
       http://groups.google.com ),  and CPAN Search ( http://search.cpan.org
       ).  This is faster and more productive than just posting a request.

       A number of books on Perl and/or CGI programming are available.  A few
       of these are good, some are OK, but many aren’t worth your money.
       There is a list of these books, some with extensive reviews, at
       http://books.perl.org/ . If you don’t see your book listed here, you
       can write to perlfaq-workers@perl.org .

       The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl, written by the
       creator of Perl, is Programming Perl:

               Programming Perl (the "Camel Book"):
               by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant
               ISBN 0-596-00027-8  [3rd edition July 2000]
               http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/
               (English, translations to several languages are also available)

       The companion volume to the Camel containing thousands of real-world
       examples, mini-tutorials, and complete programs is:

               The Perl Cookbook (the "Ram Book"):
               by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington,
                   with Foreword by Larry Wall
               ISBN 0-596-00313-7 [2nd Edition August 2003]
               http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlckbk2/

       If you’re already a seasoned programmer, then the Camel Book might suf-
       fice for you to learn Perl.  If you’re not, check out the Llama book:

               Learning Perl
               by Randal L. Schwartz, Tom Phoenix, and brian d foy
               ISBN 0-596-10105-8 [4th edition July 2005]
               http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/learnperl4/

       And for more advanced information on writing larger programs, presented
       in the same style as the Llama book, continue your education with the
       Alpaca book:

               Learning Perl Objects, References, and Modules (the "Alpaca Book")
               by Randal L. Schwartz, with Tom Phoenix (foreword by Damian Conway)
               ISBN 0-596-00478-8 [1st edition June 2003]
               http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lrnperlorm/

       If you’re not an accidental programmer, but a more serious and possibly
       even degreed computer scientist who doesn’t need as much hand-holding
       as we try to provide in the Llama, please check out the delightful book

               Perl: The Programmer’s Companion
               by Nigel Chapman
               ISBN 0-471-97563-X [1997, 3rd printing Spring 1998]

               http://www.wiley.com/compbooks/chapman/perl/perltpc.html (errata etc)

       If you are more at home in Windows the following is available (though
       unfortunately rather dated).

               Learning Perl on Win32 Systems (the "Gecko Book")
               by Randal L. Schwartz, Erik Olson, and Tom Christiansen,

       Addison-Wesley ( http://www.awlonline.com/ ) and Manning (
       http://www.manning.com/ ) are also publishers of some fine Perl books
       such as _O_b_j_e_c_t _O_r_i_e_n_t_e_d _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _w_i_t_h _P_e_r_l by Damian Conway and _N_e_t_-

       An excellent technical book discounter is Bookpool at
       http://www.bookpool.com/ where a 30% discount or more is not unusual.

       What follows is a list of the books that the FAQ authors found person-
       ally useful.  Your mileage may (but, we hope, probably won’t) vary.

       The first (and for a long time, only) periodical devoted to All Things
       Perl, _T_h_e _P_e_r_l _J_o_u_r_n_a_l contains tutorials, demonstrations, case stud-
       ies, announcements, contests, and much more.  _T_P_J has columns on web
       development, databases, Win32 Perl, graphical programming, regular
       expressions, and networking, and sponsors the Obfuscated Perl Contest
       and the Perl Poetry Contests.  Beginning in November 2002, TPJ moved to
       a reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which subscribers can down-
       load issues as PDF documents. For more details on TPJ, see
       http://www.tpj.com/

       Beyond this, magazines that frequently carry quality articles on Perl
       are _T_h_e _P_e_r_l _R_e_v_i_e_w ( http://www.theperlreview.com ), _U_n_i_x _R_e_v_i_e_w (

       Most of the major modules (Tk, CGI, libwww-perl) have their own mailing
       lists.  Consult the documentation that came with the module for sub-
       scription information.

       A comprehensive list of Perl related mailing lists can be found at:

               http://lists.perl.org/

       The Google search engine now carries archived and searchable newsgroup
       content.

       If you have a question, you can be sure someone has already asked the
       same question at some point on c.l.p.m. It requires some time and
       patience to sift through all the content but often you will find the
       answer you seek.

       In a real sense, perl already _i_s commercial software: it has a license
       that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed
       in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large
       user community and an extensive literature.  The comp.lang.perl.*
       newsgroups and several of the mailing lists provide free answers to
       your questions in near real-time.  Perl has traditionally been sup-
       ported by Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and myr-
       iad programmers, all working for free to create a useful thing to make
       life better for everyone.

       However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a pur-
       chase order from a company whom they can sue should anything go awry.
       Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual obliga-
       tions.  Shrink-wrapped CDs with perl on them are available from several
       sources if that will help.  For example, many Perl books include a dis-
       tribution of perl, as do the O’Reilly Perl Resource Kits (in both the
       Unix flavor and in the proprietary Microsoft flavor); the free Unix
       distributions also all come with perl.

       If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or the modules
       shipped with Perl, use the _p_e_r_l_b_u_g program in the Perl distribution or
       mail your report to perlbug@perl.org or at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/
       .

       For Perl modules, you can submit bug reports to the Request Tracker set
       up at http://rt.cpan.org .

       If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see the answer to
       "What platforms is perl available for?"), a binary distribution, or a
       non-standard module (such as Tk, CGI, etc), then please see the docu-
       mentation that came with it to determine the correct place to post
       bugs.

       Read the _p_e_r_l_b_u_g(1) man page (perl5.004 or later) for more information.
